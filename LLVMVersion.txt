    [X86] matchShuffleWithSHUFPD - use Zeroable element mask directly. NFCI.
    
    We can make use of the Zeroable mask to indicate which elements we can safely set to zero instead of creating a target shuffle mask on the fly.
    
    This only leaves one user of createTargetShuffleMask which we can hopefully get rid of in a similar manner.
    
    This is part of the work to fix PR43024 and allow us to use SimplifyDemandedElts to simplify shuffle chains - we need to get to a point where the target shuffle masks isn't adjusted by its source inputs in setTargetShuffleZeroElements but instead we cache them in a parallel Zeroable mask.
