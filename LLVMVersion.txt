    [clang-doc] Serialize inherited attributes and methods

    clang-doc now serializes the inherited attributes and methods, not only the name of the base class.
    All inherited are tracked, if B:A and C:B, info of A is included in C.
    This data is stored in attribute Bases in a RecordInfo.
    Previously tracked inheritance data, stored in Parents and VParents, hasn't been removed to reduce review load.
