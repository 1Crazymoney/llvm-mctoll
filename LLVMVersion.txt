    [libomptarget] Harmonize emitting CUDA errors and general debug messages.

    Ensures that CUDA fail reasons (such as "No CUDA-capable device detected")
    are printed together with libomptarget's debug message
    (e.g. "Error when setting CUDA context"). Previously, the former was
    printed only in CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug builds while the latter was
    enabled by LIBOMPTARGET_ENABLE_DEBUG.

    With this change, also only call cuGetErrorString when the error will be
    printed.
