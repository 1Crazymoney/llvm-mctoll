    [PowerPC] Only legalize FNEARBYINT with unsafe fp math
    
    Commit 0f0330a78709 legalized these nodes on PPC without consideration of
    unsafe math which means that we get inexact exceptions raised for nearbyint.
    Since this doesn't conform to the standard, switch this legalization to depend
    on unsafe fp math.
