    [Float2Int] Make iteration over Roots deterministic
    
    Summary:
    Use a SmallSetVector instead of a SmallPtrSet when collecting
    and storing Roots.
    
    The iteration order for a SmallPtrSet is not deterministic,
    so in the past the order of items inserted in the WorkList
    inside walkBackwards has been non-deterministic. This patch
    intends to make the order of rewrites done in Float2Int
    deterministic by changing the container for the Roots set.
    
    The semantics result of the transformation should not be
    any different afaict. But at least naming of IR variables
    (when outputting the result as an ll file) should be more
    stable now.
