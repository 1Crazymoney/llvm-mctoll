    [MCA][Scheduler] Collect resource pressure and memory dependency bottlenecks.
    
    Every cycle, the Scheduler checks if instructions in the ReadySet can be issued
    to the underlying pipelines. If an instruction cannot be issued because one or
    more pipeline resources are unavailable, then field
    Instruction::CriticalResourceMask is updated with the resource identifier of the
    unavailable resources.
    
    If an instruction cannot be promoted from the PendingSet to the ReadySet because
    of a memory dependency, then field Instruction::CriticalMemDep is updated with
    the identifier of the dependending memory instruction.
    
    Bottleneck information is collected after every cycle for instructions that are
    waiting to execute. The idea is to help identify causes of bottlenecks; this
    information can be used in future to implement a bottleneck analysis.

    [OPENMP] Delay emission of the asm target-specific error messages.
    
    Summary:
    Added the ability to emit target-specific builtin assembler error
    messages only in case if the function is really is going to be emitted
    for the device.
