commit 89d3031b3ce13cc453d04cf02036a5e7d6b72524
Author: Nico Weber <thakis@chromium.org>
Date:   Mon May 11 19:04:28 2020 -0400

    llvm-lit.in: Use a raw string for LLVM_SOURCE_DIR
    
    In case the path from cmake build dir contains a backslash
    escape on Windows (which uses \ as path separator).
    
    While here, consistently use one form of quotes in this file.
    
    No intended behavior change.
