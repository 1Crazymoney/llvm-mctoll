    [RegAllocFast] Scan physcial reg definitions before assigning virtual reg definitions

    When assigning the definitions of an instruction we were updating
    the available registers while walking the definitions. Some of
    those definitions may be from physical registers and thus, they are
    not available for other definitions to take, but by the time we see
    that we may have already assign these registers to another
    virtual register.

    Fix that by walking through all the definitions and mark as unavailable
    the physical register definitions, then do the virtual register assignments.

    Include corecrt.h in stddef.h and vcruntime.h in stdarg.h to improve MS
    compatibility.  This allows some applications developed with MSVC to
    compile with clang without any extra changes.
