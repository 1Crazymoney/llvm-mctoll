    [build] Rename clang-headers to clang-resource-headers

    Summary:
    The current install-clang-headers target installs clang's resource
    directory headers. This is different from the install-llvm-headers
    target, which installs LLVM's API headers. We want to introduce the
    corresponding target to clang, and the natural name for that new target
    would be install-clang-headers. Rename the existing target to
    install-clang-resource-headers to free up the install-clang-headers name
    for the new target, following the discussion on cfe-dev [1].

    I didn't find any bots on zorg referencing install-clang-headers. I'll
    send out another PSA to cfe-dev to accompany this rename.
